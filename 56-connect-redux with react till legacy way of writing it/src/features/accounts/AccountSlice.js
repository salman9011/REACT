//1.it is part of total state
//2. in each slice we colocate as much as redux logic as possible
//3. so we don't have to jump around b/w the files , as older code based have oe folder for reducer and per file for per reducer same for action creater
// 4 . so a slice contains initial state , reducer function and action creators
